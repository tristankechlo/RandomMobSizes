- random scaling is now tied to the world random
- allow scaling of mob attributes
    - health, damage and speed can now be scaled along with the mob size
    - five options to scale those attributes
        - `none` => no scaling
        - `normal` => same scaling as the mob size
        - `square` => scaling is squared $(scaling*scaling)$
        - `inverse` => scaling is inverted $(1 / scaling)$
        - `inverse_square` => scaling is squared and inverted $(1 / (scaling * scaling))$
- new config format
    - allows to set a default scaling for all mobs
        - uses whitelist/blacklist to include/exclude mobs from the default scaling
        - accepts wildcards like `minecraft:*`
    - all special scalings for mobs are now under `scaling_overrides`
        - all scalings defined here will bypass the default scaling
- better overall config handling
    - does not always overwrite the config file anymore, minor errors will just be ignored and loading continues
    - on major errors the config file will be overwritten with the default config, and a backup of the old config will
      be created
